### 🎓 About Me

I am a Computer Science student at the University of Turin with a passion for software development, data analysis, and building practical solutions to real-world problems. My academic journey at both Università degli Studi di Torino and Liceo Scientifico Statale A. Gramsci Ivrea has equipped me with strong analytical skills and a solid foundation in computer science principles.

I enjoy working across various programming languages and technologies, with experience in Python, Java, JavaScript, and more. I'm particularly interested in data analysis, web development, and application design.
